                    hard - that's the key to success. Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what
                    is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures,
                    and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals
                    rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.</p>

                        and put everything into a venture, business success is nearly impossible. Working in teams
                        increases collaboration. And the sharing of ideas and can go a long way in giving teams a
                        productivity boost. However, with multiple individuals comprising the team, it is important to
                        keep them all motivated.</p>

                    <p class="para">Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice
                        and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do. Unless your experience is unique,
                        hard work and perseverance most often lead to success. If we are scared of hard work, we likely
                        will have a harder time reaching success. Keep an eye out for defeatist attitudes -- refuse to
                        let them infiltrate your organization.</p>

                        believe. The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears
                        are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your
                        life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward. The reward for work well done is the
                        opportunity to do more.</p>

                    because learning is simply so important. At Growth Engineering we are big believers in the
                    importance of lifelong learning. We think that there is always something new to learn and that our
                    learning journeys should never come to an end. There is no end to education. It is not that you read
                    a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are
                    born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.</p>

                    together by the internet and other electronic communication interconnections. Global village
                    describes the phenomenon of the entire world becoming more interconnected as the result of the
                    propagation of media technologies throughout the world. The term was coined by Canadian media
                    theorist Marshall McLuhan in his books The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man and
